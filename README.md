# Hello, Friend

My name is Patrick, and I am a full stack web developer currently working at Nexient. I enjoy using modern web technologies to build applications that both serve a purpose and solve technical problems in interesting ways. When I'm not developing, you can find me reading, deep diving on new programming languages/technologies, or running half marathons.
